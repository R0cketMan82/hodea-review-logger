- Shall run on Linux and Windows
    - take care about / vs \
    - Note: all compilers I know so far support Unix path names also on
      Windows, but not vice versa.
      Example:
        o #include <sys/syscall.h> also works on Windows
      but
        o #include <sys\syscall.h> fails on Linux
    --> use Unix path internally if required


- Shall support @lastreview to keep track on which files are reviewed.
    - hash over file _AFTER_ updating review comments to detect if
      file was modified after adding the @lastreview tag.


Topics to consider
------------------

- What happens if a file is removed?
- What happens if a file is renamed?
- Shall languages using other comment style than C/C++ be supported?

Software design
---------------

- Python module to handle configuration
- hodea-rl-parse    # update review and @lastreview data base
- hodea-rl-gen-html # generate html report
- hodea-rl-gen-pdf  # generate pdf report

Command line options:
-t, --template file     # generate template configuration file
-c, --config file       # configuration file to read
-b, --database_dir path # path to the directory holding the review database
-r, --report_dir        # path to the report output directory
